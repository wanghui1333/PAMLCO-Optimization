# A Novel Multi-Scale Optimization Framework Integrating Machine Learning and Economic Benefits for Smart Shale Gas Field Development

> Authors: Huijun Wang, Zhiguo Shu, Jiyong Liu, Gaofeng Zou, Liu He, and Taohua He

## Overview
This single-well optimization tool represents a component of the PAMLCO framework, designed to efficiently optimize shale gas well completion parameters. The tool employs a dual-approach strategy combining Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) proxy modeling with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to achieve optimal well designs while dramatically reducing computational time.
